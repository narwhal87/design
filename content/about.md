## About

My name is Alf Tore Pettersson and I'm studying to become a web developer.

My aim is to gain as much valuable experience and learn as many necessary tools as possible.

### Pico

Pico is the content management system (CMS) or framework used to create this site. It is a flat file CMS which means that all content is stored as simple text files, which make them easy to modify and organize.

### <i class="fab fa-sass"></i> SASS

SASS is a CSS Preprocessor that allows the user to create variables and work in a modular fashion with CSS.

### <i class="fab fa-github"></i> Git

This is a CVS, a version control system, that allows users to create different branches of the same project and to work in parallel on different things and subsequently merge branches at a later point.

### Markdown

A markup language to add formatting elements to a plaintext file. The aim is to offer the user a simple look with as little code as possible, in order to make the document readable.
